# <picture>-tag
This tag is a substitute for *** img *** tag. This allows us to display image in varrying resolutions according to the size of scrns of the user's devices 

# favicon
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="link">

# table
we can add css to specific columns or rows by using nth child(even/odd) which selects only the even or odd numbered row or column in the table and applies the css to those specific parts

we can also use hover for table or anypart of it

<colgroup> this tag helps us to group the columns in the stated number and applies css specifically to them only
